        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great Fear of Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot believe my body won’t mind being cremated, and then ashes, scattered or not,&lt;br /&gt;
Cannot believe my body won’t feel it, won’t have a mind and a con-&lt;br /&gt;
  ciousness to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;
And I wonder whether, on my deathbed, I’ll think about that; I hope I don’t.&lt;br /&gt;
I imagine I’ll be in a hospital, having what’s known as a peaceful, painless dying;&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone doing their best for my body — morphine or whatever, maybe massaging&lt;br /&gt;
And loving, even if none of them are my loved or loving ones.&lt;br /&gt;
I hope I don’t think for even a smidgen that all that very best for my body will, once&lt;br /&gt;
  dying has become death, turn into the very worst;&lt;br /&gt;
I cannot believe the sheet over my face won’t suffocate,&lt;br /&gt;
Nor the wheeling of me out of the room won’t frighten&lt;br /&gt;
Nor the rest of it&lt;br /&gt;
The rest of it;&lt;br /&gt;
Again, I hope, on my deathbed, I forget about all that.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not forgetting now but I hope I forget later
Hope I forget lat&lt;em&gt;est&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My very latest of all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mousetraps Circa 1940’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes my parents heard mice scurrying about in the attic.&lt;br /&gt;
They set traps, the old-fashioned kind — the kind that snap on their tails.&lt;br /&gt;
Whenever one of them worked, my father would put the whole kit-‘n’-caboodle in a&lt;br /&gt;
paper bag and head for the fields.&lt;br /&gt;
Once he took me with him. I watched him open the bag and then the trap.&lt;br /&gt;
The mouse scampered out among the wildflowers.&lt;br /&gt;
“’Bye, little mousie,” my father crooned. “Bye bye, mousie.”&lt;br /&gt;
The straight line that the mouse scampered along got longer and longer.&lt;br /&gt;
I guessed it knew where it was going.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bangles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ample, firm, pudgy, dramatic&lt;br /&gt;
and visible from any distance.&lt;br /&gt;
They’re the only bracelets I wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, though, there’s been a problem:&lt;br /&gt;
They keep touching some part of my arm.&lt;br /&gt;
They make that part feel annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if I raise my arm,&lt;br /&gt;
keep it vertical,&lt;br /&gt;
they touch that entire cross-section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I lower my arm (upside-down vertical)&lt;br /&gt;
they sit on my hand like water.&lt;br /&gt;
They won’t leave my hand alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They make my arm tired.&lt;br /&gt;
They’ll give it gangrene.&lt;br /&gt;
There’s no good position for that arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s only lately.&lt;br /&gt;
Am I getting too old for bangles?&lt;br /&gt;
Do I have to start wearing those twiddly, weak, weightless, insipid, museum-type&lt;br /&gt;
  bracelets?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind you can barely see?&lt;br /&gt;
The kind you can barely touch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OPINION: Disappearing 'Civic Pride' in Stockton</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry, city leaders, but the decision to purchase the waterfront towers as the new City Hall is unacceptable. There is no “civic pride” in entering a nondescript, glassy tower lacking any architectural thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are expensive repairs and improvements to be made to historic City Hall, but that is the case with any historic structure, and Stockton is on its last leg when it comes to remaining historic buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If costly repairs were the only thing taken into consideration with historic structures, none would exist. It is noted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recordnet.com/news/20170919/council-approves-waterfront-city-hall/1&quot;&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt; that there are “no plans to demolish” City Hall - just wait until it has been vacant for more than a year and see how things deteriorate further, or (surprise) catch fire. Then there will be no choice but to raze it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently returned to Stockton, my hometown, after ten years of living in the Bay Area. I am very happy with my decision, and there are many pluses to living here; however, the dedication to preservation here is appalling, and upsetting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those leaders in the 19th and early 20th centuries had it right by designing public buildings to have a grand presence, instilling pride in our society. There seems to be a newer school of thought that spending a dime on a historic and grand public buildings is poor form, because it appears wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One must think beyond the physical investment and to the larger investment into city pride. There are other, more visible issues in our beautiful city, but just once, it would be nice to see the leaders double down on preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not the easy way out, but it is easily the most rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Windows not so Transparent: Downtown Under Stress</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;California’s housing crisis is leaving local government officials in a tough situation. For one of the hardest hit cities in the housing market crash, Stockton, Calif., the sense of urgency that has been building over the last two years has left &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-joaquin-county/stockton/&quot;&gt;residents facing higher rents&lt;/a&gt; and city officials scrambling to implement solutions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hcd.ca.gov/community-development/housing-element/docs/stockton_5th_draft121715.pdf&quot;&gt;The City is required&lt;/a&gt; to develop 4,400 units in the downtown and greater downtown areas, and 14,000 units elsewhere, within the 2007 city limits. No doubt, that is a lofty challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin satisfying this requirement, the City of Stockton adopted the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stocktonca.gov/government/departments/econDev/eDevBusInf.html&quot;&gt;Downtown Infrastructure Infill Incentive Program&lt;/a&gt; (DIIIP) on July 7, 2015, encouraging infill development within the eastern core of its downtown. The goal? To support business expansion, bring private investment to the area, and generate additional jobs and revenue for the city. Specifically, the program would provide financial incentives to eligible parties looking to develop new market-rate residential or mixed use projects in Downtown Stockton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money could be used to fund public offsite infrastructure—from street improvements, like bike lanes, road striping, and crosswalks; to public signage, landscaping, or parklets—associated with eligible infill projects within the designated program boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/DIII-project-boundaries.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DIII-project-boundaries.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Designated program boundaries for the Downtown Infrastructure Infill Incentive Plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockton seeded the program with $900,000 from the current fiscal year budget (2015-16) to establish the fund and send a signal to developers that they were open for business. The funding sources for future years would “potentially be funded” through a hodgepodge of sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there were a few requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project had to consist of a minimum of 35 new market-rate residential units and/or a minimum of 30,000 square feet of new or newly renovated retail or commercial space within the designated boundaries. In addition, the applicant must have also made a capital investment of no less than $500,000, and the public improvement project costs must have totaled at least $100,000 to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disbursement process for the grant was to be on a reimbursement basis, requiring interested parties to create a Downtown Infrastructure Infill Incentive Reimbursement Agreement (DIIIRA) that would detail the public improvements, cost, source of funds, and terms of the reimbursement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 23, 2016, the City of Stockton approved a master development plan for &lt;a href=&quot;http://tenspacedev.com/projects/&quot;&gt;Open Window Project&lt;/a&gt;, LLC (OWP), an ambitious land use plan that would bring over 1,000 housing units to the downtown area. The project passed through the city council with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recordnet.com/article/20160224/NEWS/160229837&quot;&gt;unanimous support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the lone community member who spoke up at the public meeting addressing concerns of access, the developer stated that inclusionary housing was a priority that was taken very seriously by the firm. At the same meeting, the City waived the need for the developer to conduct a detailed review of environmental effects due to construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HXFngGOZXk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not much information aside from this video can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tenspacedev.com/projects/&quot;&gt;developer’s website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight months later, on Oct. 18, 2016, the City approved its first DIIIRA with the developer, OWP. The full agreement &lt;a href=&quot;http://stockton.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?M=F&amp;amp;ID=f68b19a4-ef3b-4ed8-b7e0-312255437e37.pdf&quot;&gt;can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlights from the resolution passed that evening:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developer was “ready to commence construction of a Phase I project,” to include 150 market-rate housing units, 62 affordable housing units, and 92,400 s.f. of commercial/retail space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;City authorized $1.8 million from prior fiscal year budgets, 15-16 and 16-17.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;City Manager, Kurt Wilson, was authorized to increase the total reimbursement to $3.8 million in subsequent fiscal years “subject to City Council appropriation…in future fiscal years’ budgets.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developer must meet the minimum 150 market-rate residential units and/or a minimum of 90,000 s.f. of new/newly renovated commercial space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once project requirements were met, City authorized disbursement of payments based upon key milestones made: issuance of building permits for the public infrastructure improvements and for a Phase I project, for which the payment was to be $760,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, on May 9, the City approved an amendment to the DIIIRA, releasing a prepayment of the reimbursement to the developer “without the developer first obtaining building permits.” In return, the developer put up seven properties until the debt cleared. The properties? Three car lots, two decaying warehouses, and two dirt lots where a 125-year-old house stood less than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/ten-space-lienproperties.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ten-space-lienproperties.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Some of the properties put on lien by the developer for an advance on the reimbursement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, just five months later, the City is being asked to again, amend the reimbursement agreement, increasing the committed amount from the original $1.8 million to $6.18 million with OWP, due to “significant” changes to the scope of the project. This time, the proposed funding source for the difference being Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds that already fall short of meeting local needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes to the scope include an increase of total units to 261, but also account for a decrease in the number of affordable units to just 30, as well as the addition of one city block. The supplemental information included in the agenda for this evening’s council meeting does not show a new project map with the new Phase I boundaries. The City of Stockton has not yet confirmed whether or not the building permits for either the public infrastructure improvements or Phase I of the project have been issued, or requested, by the developer at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many unanswered questions about this ever-changing project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, what was the $760,000 prepayment used for, if no permits have been issued to date? What is the true number of units the public can expect the developer to complete in Phase I of this project–how many will be market-rate, how many will be affordable, and isn’t it reasonable to assume that if the number of affordable housing units is decreasing, the City’s commitment should also decrease? The engineer’s estimate shows a doubling of costs for Phase I of the project, yet most of the costs are related to elements of Phase I that have already been predicated–why? Why is the City being asked to remove its only safeguard–the annual budget review process–while increasing the reimbursement by $4.38 million? Finally, and probably most importantly, what is the link between this change in scope and the use of CDBG funds, of which at least 70% must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons, when the number of affordable units is decreasing by over 50%?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City Council meeting to discuss this item will be held at 5:30 p.m. tonight, Oct. 3rd, at Stockton City Hall, 525 N. El Dorado St.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gorilla Masks and Guerrilla Art Expose Inequality</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Political, raw, and feminist? Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guerrillagirls.com/&quot;&gt;Guerrilla Girls&lt;/a&gt; are just that. Since 1985, the Guerrilla Girls have created public art that addresses politics, gender, and inequality that women throughout the world experience. They call themselves Guerrilla because of their tactics, placing large scale banners on billboards and using projectors on the side of  buildings.  They create a conversation of equality between gender and artists of color, particularly in the arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/guerrilla-CBLBARNESFOUNDATION.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;guerrilla-CBLBARNESFOUNDATION.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group also wears gorilla masks in public to remain anonymous. While they are public in their art and expression, they remain mysterious about their own identities. Anonymity keeps them safe and adds to their message; anyone could be a Guerrilla Girl, and they are everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2016-WealthPower-guerrilla.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2016-WealthPower-guerrilla.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years the Guerilla Girls have exhibited all around the world and have received critical acclaim. Their recent traveling exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Not Ready to Make Nice&lt;/em&gt;, started on Sept. 7  and runs until Oct. 22 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vergeart.com/exhibitions/not-ready-to-make-nice-guerrilla-girls-in-the-artworld-and-beyond/&quot;&gt;Verge Center for the Arts&lt;/a&gt; in Sacramento. This exhibition displays a collection of 30 years of their radical and thought-provoking artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/guerrilla-SUNDAY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;guerrilla-SUNDAY.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their display of works is done so with an alarming amount of statistics. One poster reads, “Women in America earn only 2/3 of what men do. Women artists earn only 1/3 of what men artists do.” The Guerrilla Girls graphically display women and artists of color as underrepresented in the arts and still suppressed after years of having “equal” rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/guerrilla-girls-mfc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;guerrilla-girls-mfc.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ask yourself, “How many women exhibitions has my local art museum or gallery had?” “How many women are featured at the Crocker Art Museum or Haggin Museum right now?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition, to their exhibition at Verge, they also will be giving a lecture at California State University, Sacramento, on Oct. 5.  The event will take place at the University Union at 7:30pm. The event is FREE. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theuniversityunion.com/unique/event/guerrilla-girls&quot;&gt;Find more information here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Bring Millions for Stockton's Most Disadvantaged</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;California often leads the nation when it comes to acknowledging and searching for ways to address climate change. The state’s first-of-its-kind &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/capandtrade.htm&quot;&gt;Cap-and-Trade Program&lt;/a&gt; highlights its innovation. The program was recently extended in the state legislature to 2030 (ten years past its initial 2020 horizon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cap and Trade works by setting an annual “cap” on the total amount of carbon emissions attributable to businesses within the state. Each year this cap declines. Businesses are then required to purchase permits which allow for a certain amount of emissions to be released. A certain number of permits are allocated for free, but if a business is in need of more, it must purchase these permits from the state. These permits are sold quarterly, and the revenue gained from these sales is funneled into a suite of programs, called California Climate Investment Programs, which are aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is time for our city to “walk the walk” as it pertains to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California also recognizes the burden of environmental pollution and the negative effects of a changing climate (increased summer temperatures, drought, and other extreme weather events) disproportionately impact vulnerable communities. For instance, low-income and minority neighborhoods are often located near heavily trafficked roadways and freeways, industrial sites, and other environmentally unsafe landscapes. These burdens are captured in a mapping tool called CalEnviroScreen. The state uses this tool to assess which places are priorities for investment, or what it refers to as “disadvantaged communities.”
Stockton is high on that priority investment list. A quick search with the CalEnviroScreen mapping tool shows the city awash in red, the color indicating the highest rate of environmental and social burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;juxtapose&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;570&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=33ecf728-7881-11e7-b5f8-0edaf8f81e27&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arcg.is/1H4nrL&quot;&gt;The CalEnviroScreen maps &lt;/a&gt;(on the right) show the widespread, burdened neighborhoods in Stockton. On the left, you can see historic redlining maps from the 1930s. To learn more about the comparison read &lt;a href=&quot;www.placeholdermag.com/culture/2017/08/17/from-segregation-to-discrimination-what-has-changed.html&quot;&gt;Javier Padilla’s article&lt;/a&gt; on redlining and environmental justice history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this deserves lamenting, and acknowledgement that we have collectively failed to protect those in our city who need it most, it also provides an avenue of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City of Stockton should work to benefit its citizens living in these disadvantaged neighborhoods by pursuing the funds available through the California Climate Investment Programs. The programs are varied, but one in particular – &lt;a href=&quot;http://sgc.ca.gov/Grant-Programs/Transformative-Climate-Communities-Program.html&quot;&gt;The Transformative Climate Communities&lt;/a&gt; (TCC) Program – has the potential to bring meaningful, climate-conscious investment to our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its first year, the program has already selected Fresno as the lucky recipient of $70 million. These funds will be directed toward community-driven improvements: affordable housing, improved public transportation, enhancements to the urban tree canopy, and massive workforce development programs aimed at benefiting residents living in those red CalEnviroScreen neighborhoods. Each improvement is on the table to be funded. Fresno has taken great strides to ensure the process is inclusive, allowing all who live or work in disadvantaged neighborhoods to vote on the projects to be awarded funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresno was not selected by accident. Over the past decade, elected and administrative leadership have worked hard to lobby Sacramento on behalf of their communities. The city overhauled its zoning code and worked to create neighborhood plans that laid the foundation for these improvements to take place. As Stockton sheds its post-bankruptcy hesitancy, it, too, is beginning to seek out and pursue these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of community-based organizations in Stockton has started to coalesce around the TCC Program’s smaller Planning Grant opportunity. These funds, up to $250,000, will allow the city to start building and documenting a collaborative planning process  to prime itself for future investment on a scale similar to Fresno (should the city be awarded, it will be prioritized for future funding awards). However, this process should not be limited to these initial groups. In order to ensure the projects identified for future TCC funding are representative of community needs, significant outreach must occur. This outreach, which will likely extend over the next two years, will start next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/transformative-climate-communities-stockton-meeting-tickets-37769999084&quot;&gt;public meeting will be held&lt;/a&gt; at Stockton’s Civic Auditorium from 6 to 8 p.m. this Tuesday, Sept. 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be food, childcare, and translation services available. At this meeting, information on the TCC Program, as well as a proposed planning area based on CalEnviroScreen data, will be presented. As a member of this TCC planning group, and as a resident of Stockton, I urge anyone who may be interested to make a visit to learn more about this program and how it could benefit our community. It is time for our city to “walk the walk” as it pertains to climate change, and ensure that our future investments both protect and empower those who have been left vulnerable to environmental racism and injustice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Port City Stories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to My City:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     The air here is as stagnant as the people who call Stockton home. Breathing it in weighs down your lungs with hot, muggy oxygen, perfumed with the smell of the Delta scum. The Delta stank is a special combination of farm water run-off, fish, and whatever remains of the poor soul some local gang has disposed of recently. Growing up here, it’s no secret what lurks in the waterways that intersect our streets and homes. Whenever a girl goes missing from the local university the first thing the police do is ready the dragnets and scuba gear. I’ve never heard of a missing girl being found alive here.&lt;br /&gt;
     Stockton, California is the 8th most dangerous city in America; growing up here you learn real quick which parts of town to avoid. At least once a month the news will show reports of a body being found at a local playground, park, or neighborhood. If you manage to make it through high school without knowing someone who got pregnant, joined a gang, or got friendly with some rocks or a needle, then you are either lucky, or your family is from one of the two nice neighborhoods. A man once explained to me that most cities are made up of good, friendly places, with sparse pockets of bad areas that drag down the whole city’s reputation. He told me, “Stockton is not one of those places; you need to look very hard to find a nice place around here.”&lt;br /&gt;
     After the housing market took a bad turn in the early 2000s, Stockton was the largest city to ever declare bankruptcy, until 2013 when Detroit stole that title from us. We are home to over 70 gangs that push the drugs on our streets and put the bullets in our storefronts and homes. I’ve heard stories that our city was once a thriving metropolis—home to a major port, booming businesses, and miles of farmland that supplied the world with fresh produce. If you search hard enough, you can see remnants of that time: an abandoned military base, long empty skyscrapers downtown; they stand tall, serving as the brick and steel headstones for our brief age of industry. Under some of the older homes and buildings lie dormant bomb shelters. Relics from the Red Scare when, as a city, we were considered important enough to be obliterated.&lt;br /&gt;
     The port bottomed out around the late 50s, but a few of the farms are still here. In the summers, my friends and I would run amok in the fields; we weren’t allowed to play in our front yards for fear of being gunned down or hit by the street racers. Crushing the heads of ripe tomatoes under our faded kicks, we would set off towards adventure: catching lizards, climbing hay bales, and playing hide and seek in the wavy green corn fields. We wouldn’t return home until the sun began to sink low over the top of Mt. Diablo. Looking back, it’s hard to believe that by making your way around one rickety old fence, you could find yourself so far removed from the grime that seemed to be imbedded in the city. Stockton isn’t like most cities where kids are free to safely enjoy their youth. Growing up we had to carve our own lush, safe, little pocket in an otherwise grim concrete existence…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/port-city-stories-pic5-min.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;port-city-stories-pic5-min.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Missing Mr. Cashmere:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Though the fields served as our safe haven, there were still spaces within its rich expanses where we dared not venture. To the far south was an abandoned barn covered in graffiti, which belonged to the Norteños; they were the reason why we had to come home before sunset. Somewhere in the north was an abandoned water treatment plant, whose cracked concrete structure and surrounding lot had been overrun with camps of homeless drifters. Along the main channel of the Delta, in the far west, a long line of caravans, trailers, and busses snaked along the water’s edge like a stalled train. Inside each, behind boarded up windows, junkies would cook meth over propane stoves. This was years before “Breaking Bad” would make it cool. Over the course of our adolescence, my friends and I would have run-ins with each of these colorful groups of characters, but none of these experiences would compare to the terror we felt on the day we set out to uncover the mystery of the missing Mr. Cashmere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     My father is a businessman—that fact stands out clearly from the moment you meet him. He is vibrant and affable, drawing you into inescapable conversation, I don’t think he could be quiet to save his life. My mother and I made up a game for whenever he walks into a room. We begin a countdown to see how long it takes him to begin speaking; so far, he has yet to make it past 12 seconds. Because of his friendly demeanor, he knew everyone in our neighborhood, and consequently, all of their dirty laundry. My father could gossip with the best of them, and his favorite partner in crime was our neighbor from across the street, Julie. She looked a bit like a walking stick bug, tall and thin with large eyes, magnified by her red, cat-eye glasses. Julie lived for the neighborhood gossip; she was the perfect stereotype of a lonely housewife, and when she wasn’t hitting on all of her married neighbors’ husbands, she was sniffing out their secrets. For hours, my father and Julie would cluck away about who was getting divorced, gawk upon learning of home foreclosures, and complain about someone’s delinquent children and whatever trouble they were up to that week. Julie and my father were as thick as thieves, their love of slander and scandal cementing their friendship.&lt;br /&gt;
     One evening over dinner, my father casually mentioned that the father of one of his clients had gone missing, passing the comment as casually as he would the mashed potatoes. His lack of details piqued my interest, and I immediately began digging for more information. Sensing a captive audience, my old man delivered a story that would set into motion one of the most traumatic moments of my childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     The tale he told me goes like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     One chilly fall evening, one of our neighbors—we’ll call him Mr. Cashmere—a stout Arabic man, decided to take an evening stroll along the Delta. He had been advised by his doctors to start exercising each day to help treat a heart condition. Donning a windbreaker to ward off the frigid air, as well as a brand-new pair of orthopedic shoes, he had set off on the first walk of his new healthy lifestyle. His family said he left an hour or so before sunset, giving him plenty of time to walk from his house to the fields and back  well before the night rolled in. After an hour had passed without his return, his family began to worry. When two hours had gone by, they called the police. Once the cops became involved, the cogs in the neighborhood gossip machine began to whirr.&lt;br /&gt;
     Soon missing persons’ posters plastered the neighborhood; Mr. Cashmere’s cherubic smiling face peered out from every brick wall and telephone pole. Members of his family went door to door giving out his description, hoping for any information over his whereabouts. Rumors began to flow from the mouths of gossipy, panic-stricken housewives over garden fences and at “book club” meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     “I heard he was a drunk. He’s probably passed out in some bar downtown.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     “Well, I heard that she kicked him out, and to save face, the family is telling people he disappeared.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Their petty chatter echoed throughout the neighborhood. Meanwhile, one block down, my neighbor and close friend grieved. The missing Mr. Cashmere had been a part of the tight-knit Arabic community in our neighborhood and was beloved by all who knew him. They all knew of his heart condition and surmised that he had gone out on his walk, had a heart attack, and had fallen into the Delta—a lone splash that would mark his final resting place among the algae as he sank into a cool, watery grave.&lt;br /&gt;
     Of course, being the creepy children that we were, my friends and I saw Mr. Cashmere’s tragedy as an opportunity for adventure. We were ready and willing to form a search party to find the missing man dead, alive, or somewhere in between. We saw ourselves as the best people for the job; there was no one in Stockton who knew the fields and levees like we did. We had spent every summer day and autumn evening trekking through the fields seeking adventure. We had most of the land mapped out by the time we were 10, and at 14 the fields were more of a friend than a plot of land. An unofficial member of our group, present for each adventure, a lush, silent fixture in our lives.&lt;br /&gt;
     We set out on a Saturday morning. It was fall and the world was coated in a fog of muted grey. The Delta cut a contrast with its sepia tone waters. Four of us made up the search party. Ashley had the looks of a 90s movie cheerleader with none of the pep or bubbly kindness. She carried the water and snacks for this particular trip in her trusty black and white JanSport. Crow, a boy who never in his life owned a pair of pants, but at the time was in possession of over 30 snakes, had brought along a Home Depot bucket in case we came across any reptiles in our travels. Marcus, wealthy beyond belief but stingy to the core, was sweet despite the aroma he gave off (the boy had a serious aversion to hygiene). He had brought along his walking stick and carried my first-aid kit. I completed the group, forever equipped with a camera and a compulsion to document our adventures for future nostalgia.&lt;br /&gt;
     We gathered at Marcus’ house just three days after Mr. Cashmere had gone missing. We prepared for a day’s worth of hiking over rocks and through the barbed brambles that gather at the water’s edge in fall. In order to get to the miles of farmland and waterways, we would have to mountain goat our way down the side of the levee and climb onto a rickety, green metal fence two feet out over the water. At a glance, this seemed like a dangerous task; the rocks were never firmly in one place, one misstep could mean a rolled ankle, and crutches always put an end to our activities for the season. The fence had seen better days and was known to teeter back and forth beneath the weight of even the smallest member of our group. It would groan as it swayed, warning us that the iron’s mettle was being tested each time it supported our brave descent out over the water. Despite these hazards, we were never afraid. As a group we had made our way down and around the fence more times than it would be possible to count. But our descent that day would be different, and for the first time we would make the return climb with fear firmly settled in our guts. Our trek down the rocky slope had just begun when someone pointed out something floating in the muck alongside Marcus’ dock obscured by the reeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/port-city-stories-pic3-min.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;port-city-stories-pic3-min.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Off-white orthopedic soles were the first thing I could make out, bobbing in the timid ebb and flow of the water, sneaker tips pointed towards the heavens. While his shoes floated lightly in the water, my heart sank like a stone into the pit of my stomach. We scrambled back up the levee on nervous feet and raced toward the dock, our paces slowing as our rubber soles descended the ramp towards the body. I remember he was pale and bloated—his chest bulged out, pressing into his damp windbreaker in a way that signified he had been in the water for a long while. He looked nothing like the smiling face on the missing posters. His eyes had swollen shut and his lips were exaggeratedly puffed out, the little hair he had on his head was splayed out around his head swaying casually in the current of the murky water. We were paralyzed with a fearful respect; no one even attempted to touch the body and my camera remained in my backpack. This would be one experience that I would be glad to never have a photo reminder of. Our feet were stuck fast to the dock, each of us silently wondering what our next step should be. We had been so excited by the thrill of the chase that we never stopped to consider what we would do if we ever actually found a body.&lt;br /&gt;
     It was Tim, Marcus’s spindly, archaic father who eventually set us into motion. He had come outside to yell at us for being on the dock. Tim wasn’t fond of any of us being on his property and preferred when we would go out into the fields, because it meant that we weren’t disturbing the museum—like quality of his home. He stormed out of his back door, across his manicured lawn, and up the back stairs to the levee, shouting obscenities at us the whole way. We were numb to his shouting, the shock of finding Mr. Cashmere like this had us dumbstruck and, despite his tone and volume, Tim’s shouting meant nothing to us. His raving became increasingly more spirited when he realized that we weren’t moving from the dock despite his shouted threats against our lives. Tim moved as quickly as his frail old bones could carry him. He was panting from exertion by the time he had reached the dock. When he finally came to stand beside us, he took a large gulp of air, presumably to continue his ranting, when he noticed the body. The shock swallowed whatever curses he had prepared; when he did finally speak, it was to calmly tell us to return home. He must have called the police to report the body, though he never told the cops it was we who had found the missing man. I like to think he did that to protect us from the police interviews and the neighborhood gossip that would have been sure to follow.&lt;br /&gt;
     We never spoke of the event to each other, though the toll it took on each of us was obvious. That fall we walked around with deep black bags ever-present beneath our eyes. Our once beloved fields now set the stage for one of our most heinous nightmares. Each remaining missing persons’ poster we passed was a morbid reminder of a distorted face our eyes could never unsee. For months, my dreams were plagued by visions of Mr. Cashmere’s bloated face appearing in different settings. Sometimes a vision of his body would appear at swim practice, his figure racing horizontal beneath me as I cut through the water, unable to shake him. I once saw him in my bathtub in a tangled mess of Delta weeds. Eventually the dreams stopped. Spring brought color back to the fields and to our faces, and our misadventure drifted away into our subconsciousness, a dreaded memory of suburban obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&quot;No Parking&quot; at PARK(ing) Day in Stockton</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a long time, I woke up with that little-kid, Christmas morning feeling. It was Stockton’s first PARK(ing) Day, and I couldn’t wait for the downtown community to wake up and see what awaited them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard about PARK(ing) Day when I was working for a hotel on 7th and Mission in San Francisco, which is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; in SOMA, but it felt a lot more like the Tenderloin. It was considered an undesirable area of the city, mostly because it was industrial, had its fair share of abandoned buildings, and lacked any public space. Our neighbors at Rebar, a design firm and founders of PARK(ing) Day, told us about the event and asked if we wanted to participate. They said PARK(ing) Day was a way to show what’s possible when public space takes the place of parking space. All we needed to do was pay the meter in front of our hotel and use the space to create something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/saveourcity-parkingday.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;saveourcity-parkingday.JPG&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Spotted on PARK(ing) Day in Stockton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of the event, we set out a rug, a few chairs, and a coffee table. We also wheeled out the hotel’s photo booth. People that worked in the area stopped in for a chat and those that couldn’t stop at least greeted us with a smile. Hotel employees came out on their break and talked about things besides laundry and obnoxious guests. Many people from the neighborhood appreciated the photo booth—some of them hadn’t seen a picture of themselves in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARK(ing) Day was originally designed to help people rethink the meaning of public space. The reason why I find it to be so valuable, and why I love the fact that it’s now taking place in Stockton, is because it’s an easy way to give people in our community—from the office worker to the senior citizen—a place to stop and talk to one another. Sometimes, you have to fight for your community. You have to play the long game and work through the system and know the right people and pay the right dues to see what you want come to fruition. And sometimes, with a few parking spaces and some amazing people, you can make the change you want to see overnight… even if that magic exists just for a day. Just like Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What a Time to be a Latin American Artist</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;James Cuno, art historian and curator of the Getty Museum, wrote this quote in reference to people visiting museums after the September 11, 2001 attacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’d like to think that by providing and preserving examples of beauty, museums foster a greater sense of caring in the world and urge their visitors to undergo a radical decentering before the work of art.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Latin American artists accomplish what Cuno is referring to by illustrating the Latin American experience in the United States through artistic mediums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The identity politics war going on in the U.S., a war that often feels &lt;em&gt;ajena&lt;/em&gt; (poorly translated by Google as “foreign” but not quite the same), has taken over our mental and emotional environment. Latin American people have struggled for survival, human rights, and fair representation in countless environments, including the arts. The announcement of the end of DACA (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/daca-trump-congress/index.html&quot;&gt;Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals&lt;/a&gt;) has been the last straw in a mount of injustice, yet in a moment of clarity I noticed many West Coast art institutions had been curating shows that represent people of Latin American heritage. We are facing a terrifying era, and I hope we can sense that beauty and caring for the world in the arts being made by our own kind.&lt;br /&gt;
Below are some relatable exhibitions you can visit in California for all those searching for a sublime moment in desperate times:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Amazon a Job Creator or Job Destroyer?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 22, 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fox40.com/2017/08/22/amazons-new-stockton-facility-expected-to-create-more-than-1000-full-time-jobs/&quot;&gt;Amazon announced the coming of a warehouse&lt;/a&gt; to Southside Stockton. Many see this as good news— after all, it’s touted to bring over a thousand jobs to the city. These jobs pay above the minimum wage, include benefits, and require a variety of skillsets. There will be a need for “pickers” and “packers,” but there will also be demand for security guards, drivers, IT specialists, medical services, janitors, and every other type of job needed to fill and operate a 600,000 plus-square-foot warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, these jobs will bring some security to residents in Stockton and surrounding areas, but how long will it last? Amazon is replacing physical storefronts, and they’re doing so with robotics. The company shows that even with the increase of robots, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/885425/amazons-massive-fleet-of-robots-hasnt-slowed-down-its-employment-of-humans/&quot;&gt;hiring is on the rise&lt;/a&gt; due to an increase in demand for Amazon products; however, these jobs are not “new” jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Breaking news Amazon to bring 1000 jobs to Stockton with a new 600,000 sq ft. facility! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/reinventStockton?src=hash&quot;&gt;#reinventStockton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Michael Tubbs (@MichaelDTubbs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MichaelDTubbs/status/900078992601997312&quot;&gt;August 22, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mayor Michael Tubbs celebrating Amazon bringing 1,000 jobs to southside Stockton.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has nationally out-competed big-box stores (e.g. Sears, Circuit City, Sports Authority, and Borders) and countless mom-and-pop shops. Over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.challengergray.com/press/press-releases/2017-june-job-cut-report-31105-june-cuts-retail-leads&quot;&gt;60,000 retail positions were cut&lt;/a&gt; in the first half of 2017 alone. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.challengergray.com/press/press-releases/2017-june-job-cut-report-31105-june-cuts-retail-leads&quot;&gt;According to a report from 2016,&lt;/a&gt; “counting all the jobs in Amazon distribution centers, Amazon sales produced a net loss of 222,000 retail jobs (an increase of 29 percent) nationwide.” Not only that, but the closure of physical stores over its digital competitors lead to a loss of property tax, rent rates, and property values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Amazon sales produced a net loss of 222,000 retail jobs nationwide”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason why there will be 1,000 jobs at Stockton’s newest warehouse is because the field of robotics still can’t replicate the human hand. How would a robot know the angle and force of pressure to apply when picking up the many objects we order online: shirts, pottery, bread, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0046GK1AI?tag=bfbetsy-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=4431391%2C17%2C24%2Cd%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A0&quot;&gt;business casual husband pillows&lt;/a&gt; without damaging them in the process? Something so trivial for us, like petting a dog without crushing its skull, is still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/grasping-robots-compete-to-rule-amazons-warehouses/&quot;&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; for machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently worked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://su.org/summits/su-global-summit/&quot;&gt;Singularity Global Summit&lt;/a&gt;, and I had a chance to listen to futurologists, idealists, and wide-eyed geeks. One thing was clear: the future is coming, and it’s happening faster than we can adjust our fragile economic systems. Just recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/24/india-ban-driverless-cars-protect-jobs/&quot;&gt;India banned self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;, because it would take away too many jobs. But that’s not stopping car manufacturers from continuing their research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Amazon is a leader in robotics, which will help the company become more efficient and consistent. The company currently “employs” tens of thousands of robots, a key piece in their system that help shave off that extra dollar or two from your dog food versus the market down the street. Free shipping and a smiling box later, you reap the benefit of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner and I worked with these robots at the Amazon Fulfillment Center in Tracy, Calif.. I was a picker, and he was a packer. We worked ten hours a day, four days a week. During training, we were warned that we would be in physical pain from long hours of standing. We bought new shoes with lots of padding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked in retail stores, call centers, restaurants, and medical offices, yet working at this warehouse was the hardest job I’ve had. As a picker, my job was to pick items from tall fabric shelves and place them in a bin. I performed my duties alone in a 5-by-8-foot space for the entirety of my month-long employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large, yellow shelving towers seemed to float towards my station, until I noticed little orange robots that looked like oversized roombas carrying them throughout the warehouse. Before Kiva, pickers had to run around the warehouse trying to find items. Some walked or ran more than 12 miles a day and one worker with heart problems &lt;a href=&quot;http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/life-and-death-amazon-temp/&quot;&gt;died while working&lt;/a&gt;. Now, we just stay at our workstation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/employee.png&quot; alt=&quot;employee.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I nearly turned into a robot. They call these robots Kiva, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/meet-amazons-busiest-employee-the-kiva-robot/&quot;&gt;which were introduced in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. The bots reduced the time it would take to fulfill an order from 90 to 15 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not far off when Amazon will replace its fleshy employees for a handsy silicone robot. The company is committed to solving that problem. They just announced their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robocup2017.org/eng/amazon_robitics.html&quot;&gt;second annual competition&lt;/a&gt; in Tokyo where participants will try to solve this problem for a prize of $250,000, in addition to a possible partnership with Amazon. How close are we until we develop robots that can substitute pickers and packers? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/grasping-robots-compete-to-rule-amazons-warehouses/&quot;&gt;About 5 years. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Kiva-robot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kiva-robot.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;They’re kind of cute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, these robots will replace humans just to save us an extra two or three dollars on this bag of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Cotton-Unique-Friends-Birthday/dp/B01E9D0OR2&quot;&gt;unicorn farts&lt;/a&gt;. And when that happens, we can only hope that our mentality and economy has adjusted so that we don’t have to compete with robots, but we can improve our quality of life. Or perhaps it’s time for all of us to vote with our dollar, if we want to keep a small business open, maybe we could spare the extra five dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What has Changed? From Segregation to Discrimination</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We must’ve moved about five times in five years. Every Christmas we lived in a different house. Since we moved to Stockton, California, my parents were able to upgrade our family into bigger homes. First we stayed with my grandparents, then a two bedroom, then three, until we each had our own rooms. Once we left Mexico, it seemed as if we just kept migrating farther North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hated moving, but I did enjoy having more space—as a teenager, that was very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents bought their first home on Eight Mile Rd. A single story, cookie-cutter, 20-year-old home. A cherry tree and lawn in the front, enough space to fit three cars in the garage, and there was even a jacuzzi in the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location wasn’t great. We weren’t in the middle of nowhere. We were at the city limits of nowhere, where new hastily-built homes were sewn into the soil to meet market demand, where your neighbor was whatever crop was in season. I played in the surrounding fields where the rows of crops seemed endless, until I learned about the harmful effects of pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a developed desert, nothing but endless rows of homes, giant parking lots, and every big box store that you find in suburbia. Welcome to Any Suburb, USA. Growing up with nothing to do but leave. And you couldn’t even do that unless you had a car. We drove at least 10-15 minutes for groceries. But it didn’t matter; my family finally settled down in the nice part of town. I wouldn’t have to move again. Finally, I had my own room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years later, we moved into a smaller house. My parents lost their dream house during the 2008 housing market crash. They payed $450,000, and when we left in 2009, it wasn’t even worth half of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-downtown-to-uptown-and-suburbia&quot;&gt;From Downtown to Uptown and Suburbia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly five months ago, I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.placeholdermag.com/culture/2017/01/14/racisminyourneighborhood.html&quot;&gt;the racist practice of redlining in America’s neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt;, including Central Valley cities, such as Sacramento, Stockton, and Fresno. Following World War II, FDR’s New Deal America invested heavily on infrastructure and providing homes to soldiers. These policies encouraged racism in real estate by denying loans and investments to areas which experienced “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.placeholdermag.com/culture/2017/01/14/racisminyourneighborhood.html&quot;&gt;infiltration of ‘Mexicans, negroes, and orientals.&lt;/a&gt;” This practice of redlining mixed areas steadily &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.placeholdermag.com/culture/2017/01/14/racisminyourneighborhood.html&quot;&gt;decreased property values of the urban core&lt;/a&gt;, where most people of color resided, while suburbs and businesses expanded to the outer rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, the construction of the Interstate Highway System became the scalpels that dissected what was left of these diverse neighborhoods. Those who could afford it—mostly whites—migrated to suburban communities (this came to be known as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight&quot;&gt;white flight&lt;/a&gt;”), with convenient newly constructed highways connecting them. Those who stayed were left even more disenfranchised than before and vulnerable to environmental hazards, property degradation, and lack of access to economic growth for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This historically rich and diverse community was destroyed for the sake of convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lange Luntao wrote a powerful article of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.placeholdermag.com/culture/2014/09/03/a-city-with-no-center.html&quot;&gt;the destruction of Little Manila in Stockton&lt;/a&gt;, once home to the largest population of Filipinos outside of the Philippines. All that is left of the neighborhood and its memories is a stretch of concrete that connects I-5 with 99 called the Crosstown Freeway. This historically rich and diverse community was destroyed for the sake of convenience. The story is nearly identical in most cities with concentrated communities of color including &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.regionalchange.ucdavis.edu/CapitalizingEJintheSacRegion.pdf&quot;&gt;Sacramento’s West End&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krisclarke.net/chinatown-and-west-fresno&quot;&gt;West Fresno and its Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoodline.com/2016/01/how-urban-renewal-destroyed-the-fillmore-in-order-to-save-it&quot;&gt;San Francisco’s Fillmore&lt;/a&gt;, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/little-manila-stockton.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In this image from the 70s, you can see the construction of the Crosstown Freeway cutting through what was left of Little Manila (in yellow), Chinatown, and other historically diverse areas of Stockton.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the passing of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8&quot;&gt;Fair Housing Act of 1968&lt;/a&gt; at the height of the Civil Rights movement put an end to the policies and institutions that were explicitly discriminating against people of color in housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s been nearly 50 years since redlining became illegal; what has changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short answer: not much.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;still-ill-a-legacy-of-racism&quot;&gt;Still Ill: A Legacy of Racism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most of it is destroyed, the areas where Little Manila once existed are still overburdened by a lack of investment and opportunity and suffer from a legacy of pollution. The same is true in other places. Formerly redlined neighborhoods are still among the most polluted and disenfranchised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the top ten most polluted and socioeconomically burdened census tracts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/calenviroscreen/document/ces3results.xlsx&quot;&gt;seven are in the Central Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of which are located in Fresno and Stockton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map Legend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the following slider to show the relationship of redlining and these newly created maps. &lt;strong&gt;On the left&lt;/strong&gt; are the redlining maps from the 30s and 40s, which impeded investment on communities of color (highlighted in red). The green and blue areas are the “most desirable.” &lt;strong&gt;On the right&lt;/strong&gt; is a map from CalEnviroScreen, a science-based tool prepared by CalEPA’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). The mapping tool uses environmental, health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores for every census tract in the state to compare different communities in a more equitable manner. Over 20 indicators contribute to this tool including ozone pollution, groundwater contamination, pesticides, traffic, asthma rates, education level, language isolation, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, a red area with a high score experiences a much higher pollution and socioeconomic burden than green areas with low scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sacramento’s West End continues to be disproportionately polluted and socioeconomically burdened places in California. East Sacramento, Land Park, Curtis Park, and Arden Village (not pictured) are all some of the least polluted and expensive places in Sacramento as well as least racially diverse, with over two-thirds of the population being white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;juxtapose&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;570&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=33ecf728-7881-11e7-b5f8-0edaf8f81e27&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockton’s downtown is home to two of the ten most polluted neighborhoods in the State (outlined in blue). Both are at the crossroads of the Crosstown Freeway and I-5. Some of the more affluent neighborhoods in Stockton have retained their status since the 30s, South of University of the Pacific (UOP), around American Legion, East of Victory Park, Brookside, Spanos (not pictured), and Lincoln. Although Stockton is predominantly Hispanic, those neighborhoods are the least racially mixed. South of UOP is the only census tract with a slight majority white population in Stockton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;juxtapose&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;570&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=7a0dfa90-78a4-11e7-b5f8-0edaf8f81e27&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresno claims half of the ten most burdened communities in California (outlined in blue). Here you can see most of the city in red, with the least burdened neighborhoods further north and east, away from the city center. Zooming out on the image below, places like Clovis, Gordon, North &amp;amp; Southeast Growth Area, Bullard are some of the suburbs that continue to expand Fresno’s borders. These suburbs have the highest real estate value, least amount of pollution, and whitest population (nearly 80% in some places).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t take my word for it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/36.71/-96.93&amp;amp;opacity=0.8&quot;&gt;explore the redlining maps here&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://oehha.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=4560cfbce7c745c299b2d0cbb07044f5&quot;&gt;check out CalEnviroScreen for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we still feel the legacy of these discriminatory practices. The explicit racism has become implicit, or unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to see implicit policies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/predatory-lending-wall-street-profited-minority-families-paid-price&quot;&gt;predatory lending by banks targeting people of color and low-income communities&lt;/a&gt;, burdening them with high interest rates that led to more dispossession and neighborhood instability, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/predatory-lending-wall-street-profited-minority-families-paid-price&quot;&gt;especially after the 2008 mortgage crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The hardest hit places for the house market crash were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/11/housing-meltdown-ground-zero/&quot;&gt;in the Central Valley&lt;/a&gt;: Fresno, Modesto, Bakersfield, Sacramento, and Stockton, the largest city to go bankrupt right before Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family was a victim of these loans that targeted minorities and first-time home buyers. Almost everyone I know has a family member who lost their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People of color and low-income communities continue to be disproportionately affected by environmental and socioeconomic issues as they face a lack of resources, education, time, and opportunities to engage. It’s a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government had some racist policies in real-estate for 30 years that still impact low-income communities and neighborhoods of color 50 years after those policies were made illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is part of a loose series, to see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.placeholdermag.com/culture/2017/01/14/racisminyourneighborhood.html&quot;&gt;first part click here&lt;/a&gt;. In our next story, we’ll dig a little deeper into the world of environmental justice, what it means, the effects of living in these neighborhoods, and what we can do about it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
