<p><strong>Great Fear of Death</strong></p>

<p>I cannot believe my body won’t mind being cremated, and then ashes, scattered or not,<br />
Cannot believe my body won’t feel it, won’t have a mind and a con-<br />
  ciousness to go with it.<br />
And I wonder whether, on my deathbed, I’ll think about that; I hope I don’t.<br />
I imagine I’ll be in a hospital, having what’s known as a peaceful, painless dying;<br />
Everyone doing their best for my body — morphine or whatever, maybe massaging<br />
And loving, even if none of them are my loved or loving ones.<br />
I hope I don’t think for even a smidgen that all that very best for my body will, once<br />
  dying has become death, turn into the very worst;<br />
I cannot believe the sheet over my face won’t suffocate,<br />
Nor the wheeling of me out of the room won’t frighten<br />
Nor the rest of it<br />
The rest of it;<br />
Again, I hope, on my deathbed, I forget about all that.<br />
I’m not forgetting now but I hope I forget later
Hope I forget lat<em>est</em><br />
My very latest of all.<br />
<br />

<p><strong>Mousetraps Circa 1940’s</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes my parents heard mice scurrying about in the attic.<br />
They set traps, the old-fashioned kind — the kind that snap on their tails.<br />
Whenever one of them worked, my father would put the whole kit-‘n’-caboodle in a<br />
paper bag and head for the fields.<br />
Once he took me with him. I watched him open the bag and then the trap.<br />
The mouse scampered out among the wildflowers.<br />
“’Bye, little mousie,” my father crooned. “Bye bye, mousie.”<br />
The straight line that the mouse scampered along got longer and longer.<br />
I guessed it knew where it was going.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><strong>Bangles</strong></p>

<p>Ample, firm, pudgy, dramatic<br />
and visible from any distance.<br />
They’re the only bracelets I wear.<br /></p>

<p>Lately, though, there’s been a problem:<br />
They keep touching some part of my arm.<br />
They make that part feel annoyed.<br /></p>

<p>And if I raise my arm,<br />
keep it vertical,<br />
they touch that entire cross-section.<br /></p>

<p>If I lower my arm (upside-down vertical)<br />
they sit on my hand like water.<br />
They won’t leave my hand alone.<br /></p>

<p>They make my arm tired.<br />
They’ll give it gangrene.<br />
There’s no good position for that arm.<br /></p>

<p>But that’s only lately.<br />
Am I getting too old for bangles?<br />
Do I have to start wearing those twiddly, weak, weightless, insipid, museum-type<br />
  bracelets?<br /></p>

<p>The kind you can barely see?<br />
The kind you can barely touch?<br /></p>
