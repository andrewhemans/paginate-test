<p>Growing up in Lodi, California, afforded Justin Marsh an opportunity to become acquainted with disintegration. Through his familiarity with rusting landscapes and his “grappling with trauma at a young age, [he] found that the development of [his] work is informed by characteristics of failure and collapse.”</p>

<p>Justin’s work skirts the line between photorealism and surrealism. His warm, murky tones animate forgotten relics in a way that realizes their place and value on this earth. He plucks objects from reality and blends them in his memory-drenched visions, giving them a new life that celebrates their worth. Justin “intend[s] to capture loss and imbue it with…its inherent beauty.”</p>

<p>To put yourself in front of these works, visit <a href="http://axisgallery.org/">Axis Gallery</a> in Sacramento through June 25th. If you prefer to do that with wine in your hand, attend the reception on Saturday, June 10th from 6-9pm. Looking forward, Justin is researching and working on his next project, <em>The Four Humors</em>, which he will showcase at Axis Gallery in 2018.</p>
