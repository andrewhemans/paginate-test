<p>Gioia describes herself as “a declarer of holidays, a transmitter of trivia, a cultural Argonaut and a faux anthropologist. [She is] simultaneously both neophyte and virtuoso of many skills… a hypothetical historian, a connoisseur of tedium and a collector of flotsam. It’s by virtue of these proclivities that [she] create[s].”

While you may not have heard of Gioia Fonda, you may have heard of <a href="http://www.pinkweek.org/">Pink Week</a>, an annual community celebration in the name of the color pink. Or maybe you’ve seen the Art Advice Booth at local art spaces like <a href="http://www.m5arts.com/artstreet/">ArtStreet</a> or the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Red-Museum-Sacramento/1552968105021049">Red Museum</a>. Gioia’s practice engages with the community and invites you to actively join the experience.

In her recent work, COLLIDE-O-SCOPE, Gioia gets meta and creates an installation that looks at the community, and must be operated by utilizing your community. The giant-sized kaleidoscope depicts a wild variety of everyday people that you could encounter walking down the street.

For the full experience, someone must stand on a ladder and turn the upper cylinder for the viewer crouched below. Participants can see a joyous, colorful mixture of encounters repeatedly taking place right before their eyes. Where the news today may dull our perspective on the future, Gioia reminds us to revel in ourselves and to “embrace our moments of collision — to make the most of when our paths meet with the paths of friends or strangers.”
