    <p>The following poems and photos were submitted by Kelly Walker for the first issue of Placeholder Magazine. We did not have the space but still wish to showcase her talent.</p>

<h2 id="smoke">Smoke</h2>

<p>someday,</p>

<p>this pain will be useful</p>

<p>tonight,</p>

<p>I stand in window frames</p>

<p>as tall as I am, feet planted,</p>

<p>hands grasping the open sill</p>

<p>smoking cigarettes that taste like you.</p>

<p>I think thoughts of you,</p>

<p>and the dogs howl,</p>

<p>thinking of the moon.</p>

<p>my mother told me to let go.</p>

<p>I told her I would,</p>

<p>if I could find a place to</p>

<p>set you down.</p>

<p>but my hands are full of you,</p>

<p>the vice you mean to me:</p>

<p>and I realized this (too late)</p>

<p>that you, this love of you</p>

<p>is a vice that I grasp onto</p>

<p>like the lung full of stale smoke</p>

<p>that I exhaled</p>

<p>when you locked me in this room.</p>

<p>You are like those cigarettes I need</p>

<p>when I have no use of you.</p>

<p>As you fade, I hang</p>

<p>from windows, cigarette between fingers</p>

<p>and I want to sit on dark porches</p>

<p>put my lips around you</p>

<p>suck you in</p>

<p>(inhale)</p>

<p>I think thoughts of the moon</p>

<p>and the dogs howl,</p>

<p>thinking of you.</p>

<h2 id="grammar">Grammar</h2>

<p>we talked about dying</p>

<p>for a while, I wanted to talk more</p>

<p>forever we went on sleeping</p>

<p>I changed the subject</p>

<p>I changed, everything to fit</p>

<p>it was wrong, those choices,</p>

<p>periods where commas should have been</p>

<p>but you and me, we’ve been parentheses</p>

<p>when a bookend was</p>

<p>what I needed. You came apart,</p>

<p>and I wanted inside your seams.</p>

<p>Instead I asked tiny questions,</p>

<p>full as I could make them with intentions</p>

<p>(but empty still</p>

<p>how I wish I could stitch you</p>

<p>piece to broken piece of me)</p>
